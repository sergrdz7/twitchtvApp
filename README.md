# Twitch.tv App 

## A freeCodeCamp Front-End Project

---

### Description:

The point of this project is to familiarize with twitch.tv's JSON api. The user should be able to see a list of streaming channels and to see information important information about those channels. 

---

### Requirements/User-Stories

* User Story: I can see weather Free Code Camp is currently streaming
* User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel 
* User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming. I can see additional details about what they are streaming
* User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
Hints Provided by freeCodeCamp

* Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.

* Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.

*Hint: UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
